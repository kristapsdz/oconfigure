This is a simple configuration script use for some
[BSD.lv](https://www.bsd.lv) project sources.
Its mission is to provide [OpenBSD](https://www.openbsd.org) portability
functions and feature testing.

It allows easy porting to Linux (glibc and musl), FreeBSD, and Mac OSX.

See [versions.md](versions.md) for version information.

To use:

1. copy
[configure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kristapsdz/oconfigure/master/configure),
[compats.c](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kristapsdz/oconfigure/master/compats.c),
and
[tests.c](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kristapsdz/oconfigure/master/tests.c)
into your source tree
2. have `include Makefile.configure` at the top of your Makefile
3. have `#include "config.h"` as the first inclusion in your sources
4. read over the included bits below in case you need to guard header inclusion
5. compile compile.o and link to it

Once prepared, a user just runs `./configure` prior to running `make`.
The `configure` script will check for common features as noted in the
test files, e.g., [pledge(2)](https://man.openbsd.org/pledge.2), and
also provide compatibility for other functions, e.g.,
[strlcpy(3)](https://man.openbsd.org/strlcpy.3).

The `./configure` script may be executed in a cross-compiling
environment with the compiler and linker set appropriately.

If you have Makefile flags you'd like to set, set them when you invoke
`configure` as key-value pairs on the command-line, e.g.,

```
./configure PREFIX=/opt
```

The following flags are recognised and accepted: `LDADD`, `LDFLAGS`,
`CPPFLAGS`, `DESTDIR`, `PREFIX`, `MANDIR`, `LIBDIR`, `BINDIR`,
`SHAREDIR`, `SBINDIR`, and `INCLUDEDIR`.  Un-recognised flags are
discarded and warned about.

If, however, you want to use an alternative CC or CFLAGS, specify them
as an environmental variable.  (This may be fixed in future versions.)

```
CC=musl-gcc ./configure
```

Using oconfigure requires some work within your sources to node
compatibility areas, then some in your build environment:

```c
#include "config.h" /* required inclusion */

#if HAVE_ERR /* sometimes err.h exists, sometimes not */
# include <err.h>
#endif
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main(void) {
#if HAVE_PLEDGE /* do we have pledge? */
	if (-1 == pledge("stdio", NULL))
		err(EXIT_FAILURE, NULL);
#endif
	warnx("hello, world!"); /* compat provides this */
	return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

And then...

```sh
./configure
cc -o config.o -c config.c
cc -o main.o -c main.c
cc config.o main.o
```

Though you can just build this into your Makefile.

This framework was inspired by [mandoc](https://mandoc.bsd.lv)'s
`configure` script written by Ingo Schwarze.

What follows is a description of the features and facilities provided by
the package when included into your sources.

The compatibility layer is generally provided by the excellent portable
[OpenSSH](https://www.openssh.com/).  All copyrights are noted within
the included sources.

## b64\_ntop

This function, annoyingly, is sometimes declared but not defined.  The
following will guard against that in your sources.

```c
#if HAVE_B64_NTOP
# include <netinet/in.h>
# include <resolv.h>
#endif
```

On some systems (Linux in particular) with `HAVE_B64_NTOP`, you'll
also need to add `-lresolv` when you compile your system, else it will
fail with `undefined reference to __b64_ntop`.

If not found, provides compatibility functions `b64_ntop` and
`b64_pton`.

## Capsicum

Tests for [FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org)'s
[Capsicum](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?capsicum(4)) subsystem,
defining the `HAVE_CAPSICUM` variable with the result.
Does not provide any compatibility.
For example,

```c
#if HAVE_CAPSICUM
# include <sys/resource.h>
# include <sys/capsicum.h>
#endif
```

## err.h

Tests for the [err(3)](https://man.openbsd.org/err.3) functions,
defining `HAVE_ERR` variable with the result.

If not found, provides compatibility functions `err`, `errx`, `warn`,
`warnx`, `vwarn`, `vwarnx`.  The `<err.h>` header inclusion needs to be
guarded for systems that include it by default; otherwise, the
definitions are provided in the generated `config.h`.

```c
#if HAVE_ERR
# include <err.h>
#endif
```

## explicit\_bzero(3)

Tests for
[explicit\_bzero(3)](https://man.openbsd.org/explicit_bzero.3), defining
`HAVE_EXPLICIT_BZERO` variable with the result.

If not found, provides a compatibility function.

## INFTIM

Some systems (like OpenBSD) define INFTIM for use with
[poll(2)](https://man.openbsd.org/poll.2).
Others don't.
This defines the `HAVE_INFTIM` variable with the results and, if not
found, defines `INFTIM` to be the proper value.

## memmem(3)

Tests for the [memmem(3)](https://man.openbsd.org/memmem.3)
function, defining `HAVE_MEMMEM` with the result.
Provides a compatibility function if not found.

## memrchr(3)

Tests for the [memrchr(3)](https://man.openbsd.org/memrchr.3)
function, defining `HAVE_MEMRCHR` with the result.
Provides a compatibility function if not found.

## memset\_s

Tests for the C11
[memset\_s](http://en.cppreference.com/w/c/string/byte/memset) function,
defining the `HAVE_MEMSET_S` variable with the result.
Does not provide a compatibility function.

## md5.h

Tests for the standalone [md5(3)](https://man.openbsd.org/md5.3)
functions, defining `HAVE_MD5` with the result.

If not found, provides a full complement of standalone (i.e., not
needing any crypto libraries) MD5 hashing functions.  These are
`MD5Init`, `MD5Update`, `MD5Pad`, `MD5Transform`, `MD5End`, and
`MD5Final`.  The preprocessor macros `MD5_BLOCK_LENGTH`,
`MD5_DIGEST_LENGTH`, and `MD5_DIGEST_STRING_LENGTH` are also defined.  

If using these functions, you'll want to guard an inclusion of the
system-default:

```c
#if HAVE_MD5
# include <md5.h>
#endif
```

On some systems (FreeBSD in particular) with `HAVE_MD5`, you'll
also need to add `-lmd` when you compile your system, else it will
fail with undefined references.

## PATH\_MAX

Tests for the `PATH_MAX` variable, defining `HAVE_PATH_MAX` with the
result.
If not found, defines the `PATH_MAX` macro to be 4096.

## pledge(2)

Test for [OpenBSD](https://www.openbsd.org)'s
[pledge(2)](https://man.openbsd.org/pledge.2) function,
defining `HAVE_PLEDGE` with the result.
Does not provide any compatibility.
For example,

```c
#if HAVE_PLEDGE
# include <unistd.h> /* pledge(2) */
#endif
```

## unveil(2)

Test for [OpenBSD](https://www.openbsd.org)'s
[unveil(2)](https://man.openbsd.org/unveil.2) function,
defining `HAVE_UNVEIL` with the result.
Does not provide any compatibility.
For example,

```c
#if HAVE_UNVEIL
# include <unistd.h> /* unveil(2) */
#endif
```

## getprogname(3)

Tests for the [getprogname(3)](https://man.openbsd.org/getprogname.3)
function, defining `HAVE_GETPROGNAME` with the result.
Provides a compatibility function if not found.

This internally tests for `__progname` and
`program_invocation_short_name` if not found, so the 
`HAVE___PROGNAME` AND `HAVE_PROGRAM_INVOCATION_SHORT_NAME` macros will
also be defined.  Do not use these: use
[getprogname(3)](https://man.openbsd.org/getprogname.3) instead.

## readpassphrase(3)
Tests for the [readpassphrase(3)](https://man.openbsd.org/readpassphrase.3)
function, defining `HAVE_READPASSPHRASE` with the result.
Provides a compatibility function if not found.
The `<readpassphrase.h>` header inclusion needs to be
guarded for systems that include it by default; otherwise, the
definitions are provided in the generated `config.h`:

```c
#if HAVE_READPASSPHRASE
# include <readpassphrase.h>
#endif
```

## reallocarray(3)

Tests for the [reallocarray(3)](https://man.openbsd.org/reallocarray.3)
function, defining `HAVE_REALLOCARRAY` with the result.
Provides a compatibility function if not found.

## recallocarray(3)

Tests for the [recallocarray(3)](https://man.openbsd.org/recallocarray.3)
function, defining `HAVE_RECALLOCARRAY` with the result.
Provides a compatibility function if not found.

## sandbox\_init(3)

Tests for
[sandbox\_init(3)](https://developer.apple.com/legacy/library/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man3/sandbox_init.3.html),
defining `HAVE_SANDBOX_INIT` with the result.
Does not provide any compatibility.

## seccomp-filter(3)

Tests for Linux's
[prctl(2)](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/prctl.2.html) function,
which is the gateway for
[seccomp(2)](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/seccomp.2.html).
Defines `HAVE_SECCOMP_FILTER` if found.
Does not provide any compatibility.

*Note: this test does not mean that the sandboxing is enabled.* You'll
need to perform a run-time check for `prctl`'s return value in your
sources.

## SOCK\_NONBLOCK

Tests for [socketpair(2)](https://man.openbsd.org/socketpair.2)
supporting the `SOCK_NONBLOCK` mask as found on OpenBSD.
Defines the `HAVE_SOCK_NONBLOCK` variable.

```c
#if HAVE_SOCK_NONBLOCK
	socketpair(AF_UNIX, flags|SOCK_NONBLOCK, 0, fd);
#else
	socketpair(AF_UNIX, flags, 0, fd);
	fcntl(fd[0], F_SETFL, 
	      fcntl(fd[0], F_GETFL, 0)|O_NONBLOCK);
	fcntl(fd[1], F_SETFL, 
	      fcntl(fd[1], F_GETFL, 0)|O_NONBLOCK);
#endif
```

Does not provide any compatibility.

## strlcat(3)

Tests for the [strlcat(3)](https://man.openbsd.org/strlcat.3)
function, defining `HAVE_STRLCAT` with the result.
Provides a compatibility function if not found.

## strlcpy(3)

Tests for the [strlcpy(3)](https://man.openbsd.org/strlcpy.3)
function, defining `HAVE_STRLCPY` with the result.
Provides a compatibility function if not found.

## strndup(3)

Tests for the [strndup(3)](https://man.openbsd.org/strndup.3)
function, defining `HAVE_STRNDUP` with the result.
Provides a compatibility function if not found.

## strnlen(3)

Tests for the [strnlen(3)](https://man.openbsd.org/strnlen.3)
function, defining `HAVE_STRNLEN` with the result.
Provides a compatibility function if not found.

## strtonum(3)

Tests for the [strtonum(3)](https://man.openbsd.org/strtonum.3)
function, defining `HAVE_STRTONUM` with the result.
Provides a compatibility function if not found.

## queue(3)

Tests for the [queue(3)](https://man.openbsd.org/queue.3) header,
*sys/queue.h*.  Defines `HAVE_SYS_QUEUE` if found.  This provides all of
the basic queue functions if `HAVE_SYS_QUEUE` is not found.  To use
these functions, make sure to guard inclusion:

```c
#if HAVE_SYS_QUEUE
# include <sys/queue.h>
#endif
```

This uses `TAILQ_FOREACH_SAFE` as a basis for determining whether the
header exists and is well-formed.
This is because glibc provides a skeleton *sys/queue.h* without this
critical macro.

## systrace(4)

Tests for OpenBSD's deprecated systrace(4) interface.
Defines `HAVE_SYSTRACE` if found.
Does not provide any compatibility.

## zlib(3)

Tests for zlib(3) compilation and linking.  Defines `HAVE_ZLIB` if
found.  Does not provide any compatibility.
